Update Victim Attributes
------------------------

The following example illustrates the basic format for updating a Victim Attribute:

.. code::

    PUT /v3/victimAttributes/{victimAttributeId}
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        {updatedField}: {updatedValue}
    }

For example, the following request will update the value of the Victim Attribute whose ID is 1 and make it the default Attribute of its type:

.. code::

    PUT /v3/victimAttributes/1
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "default": true,
        "value": "Based on additional analysis, it was determined that this victim's social media, bank, and email accounts were hacked as the result of a phishing attack."
    }
