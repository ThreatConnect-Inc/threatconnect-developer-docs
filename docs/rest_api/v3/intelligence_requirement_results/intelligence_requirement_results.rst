Intelligence Requirement Results
================================

An Intelligence Requirement (IR) is a collection of topics or a research question reflecting an organization's cyber threatâ€“related priorities that guides a security or threat intelligence team's research and analysis efforts. In ThreatConnect, you can review local and global results returned by an IR's keyword query and determine the appropriate course of action to take for each result: associate the result to the IR object, archive the result, or mark the result as a false result.
