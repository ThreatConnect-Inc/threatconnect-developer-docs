Create Group Attributes
-----------------------

The following example illustrates the basic format for creating a Group Attribute:

.. code::

    POST /v3/groupAttributes
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "groupId": 12345,
        "type": "Attribute type goes here",
        "value": "Attribute value goes here"
    }

For example, the following request will create an Attribute and add it to the Group whose ID is 20:

.. code::

    POST /v3/groupAttributes
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "groupId": 20,
        "source": "Phase of Intrusion",
        "type": "Additional Analysis and Context",
        "value": "This is a very dangerous adversary."
    }
