Job Executions
==============

ThreatConnect can integrate with many third-party applications and services via TC Exchangeâ„¢ Apps. Once installed, an App leverages a corresponding Job to perform the actions that the App supports. As the Job runs, detailed logs of the execution will be collected, including the queued date, start date, completed date, server information, exit message, and status.
