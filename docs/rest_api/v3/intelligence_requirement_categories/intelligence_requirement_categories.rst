Intelligence Requirement Categories
===================================

Intelligence Requirement (IR) categories provide greater control over how to organize your IRs. For example, you can use categories to organize IRs based on different stakeholder groups (e.g., SecOps, HR, Finance) or threat actor types (e.g., Nation State, Hacktivist). When creating or updating an IR in ThreatConnect, you can choose a category to associate with the IR.
