Exclusion Lists
===============

`Indicator Exclusion Lists <https://knowledge.threatconnect.com/docs/creating-indicator-exclusion-lists>`_ prevent the import of Indicators that may be deemed legitimate or non-hostile to an organization. ThreatConnect is prepopulated with default Indicator Exclusion Lists, but you can create custom Indicator Exclusion Lists at the System and owner (i.e., Organization, Community, and Source) levels.
