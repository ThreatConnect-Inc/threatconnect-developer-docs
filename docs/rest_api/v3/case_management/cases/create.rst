Create Cases
------------

The following example illustrates the basic format for creating a Case:

.. code::

    POST /v3/cases
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "name": "Case name",
        "status": "Case status",
        "severity": "Case severity"
    }

For example, the following request will create a Case named "Phishing Investigation." It will also complete the following actions for the Case:

- Set the Case's severity to **Low**
- Set the Case's status to **Open**
- Assign the Case to smithj@threatconnect.com
- Create an Artifact within the Case and associate the Artifact to the existing Indicator whose ID is 2
- Apply the **T1566 - Phishing** ATT&CKÂ® Tag to the Case

.. attention::
    To apply an ATT&CK Tag to a Case, use either the corresponding technique ID or name. For example, to apply the **T1566 - Phishing** ATT&CK Tag to a Case, either set ``name`` to ``"Phishing"`` or ``techniqueId`` to ``"T1566"`` when defining the ATT&CK Tag object in the request body.

    Also, if you applied a new Tag to a Case and that Tag matches a synonymous Tag listed in a `Tag normalization rule <https://knowledge.threatconnect.com/docs/tag-normalization>`_, it will be converted to the main Tag listed in the rule. Similarly, if you applied a new Tag to a Case and that Tag `matches an ATT&CK Tag <https://knowledge.threatconnect.com/docs/attack-tags#converting-standard-tags-to-attck-tags>`_, it will be converted to that ATT&CK Tag.

.. hint::
    To include the ``artifacts`` and ``tags`` fields in the API response, append ``?fields=artifacts&fields=tags`` to the end of the request URL.

.. code::

    POST /v3/cases
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
        "artifacts": {
            "data": [
                {
                    "summary": "badguy.com",
                    "type": "Host",
                    "associatedIndicators": {

                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "assignee": {
            "type": "User",
            "data": {
                "userName": "smithj@threatconnect.com"
            }
        },
        "name": "Phishing Investigation",
        "severity": "Low",
        "status": "Open",
        "tags": {
            "data": [
                {
                    "techniqueId": "T1566"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
