Create Groups
-------------

To create a Group, the most basic format is:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/{groupType}
    Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "name": "Test Group"
    }

The ``{groupType}`` can be any one of the available Group types:

- ``adversaries``
- ``attackPatterns``
- ``campaigns``
- ``coursesOfAction``
- ``documents``
- ``emails``
- ``events``
- ``incidents``
- ``intrusionSets``
- ``malware``
- ``reports``
- ``signatures``
- ``tactics``
- ``threats``
- ``tools``
- ``vulnerabilities``

Some Group types require additional fields when being created. Refer to the table below for the fields required to create each Group type:

Group Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: group_fields.rst

By way of example, the query below will create an incident in the default owner:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/incidents
    Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "name": "Test Incident",
      "eventDate": "2017-7-13T00:00:00-04:00",
      "status": "New"
    }

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success",
      "data": {
        "incident": {
          "id": "54321",
          "name": "Test Incident",
          "owner": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Example Organization",
            "type": "Organization"
          },
          "dateAdded": "2017-07-13T17:50:17",
          "lastModified": "2017-07-13T17:50:17",
          "webLink": "https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=54321",
          "eventDate": "2017-7-13T00:00:00-04:00"
        }
      }
    }

Uploading Document Contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are creating a Document in ThreatConnect that is a malware sample, refer to the `the next section <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/v2/groups/groups.html#creating-a-malware-document>`_. If you are creating a benign Document and want to upload content into the Document via API, refer to the section on `uploading Document contents <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/v2/groups/groups.html#uploading-updating-document-contents>`_ for more details.

Creating a Malware Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a Document that can be uploaded into `ThreatConnect's Malware Vault <https://training.threatconnect.com/learn/article/uploading-malware-kb-article>`_ via API, include the ``malware`` and ``password`` fields when creating the Document as shown below.

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/documents/
    Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    { 
      "fileName" : "malwaresample.zip",
      "name": "malwaresample.exe",
      "malware": true,
      "password": "TCinfected"
    }

To upload a malware sample as a Document, the following steps must be taken:

-  Create a `password-protected zip file <https://askubuntu.com/questions/17641/create-encrypted-password-protected-zip-file>`__ on your local machine containing the sample.
-  Create a new Document Group, including the additional fields ``malware`` set to True and ``password`` set to the zip file's password.
- `Upload the Document contents <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/v2/groups/groups.html#update-document-contents>`_ .

.. note:: The API will validate that the malware Document is a password-protected zip file.

.. warning:: Uploading raw malware executables or weaponized Documents is strictly forbidden.

For malware uploads, An ``HTTP 400 - Bad Request`` error will be returned if the Document is not a password-protected zip file (as determined by file headers).

Create Group Metadata
---------------------

Create Group Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add an Attribute to a Group, use the following format:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}/attributes
    Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "type" : {attributeType},
      "value" : "Test Attribute",
      "displayed" : true
    }

For example, if you wanted to add a Description Attribute to the threat with the ID 12345, you would use the following query:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/threats/12345/attributes
    Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "type" : "Description",
      "value" : "Test Description",
      "displayed" : true
    }

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success",
      "data": {
        "attribute": {
          "id": "54321",
          "type": "Description",
          "dateAdded": "2017-07-13T17:50:17",
          "lastModified": "2017-07-13T17:50:17",
          "displayed": true,
          "value": "Test Description"
        }
      }
    }

To add a Security Label to an Attribute, use the following format, where ``{securityLabel}`` is replaced with the name of a Security Label that already exists in the Owner:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}/attributes/{attributeId}/securityLabels/{securityLabel}

For example, the query below will add a ``TLP:AMBER`` Security Label to the Attribute on the Threat:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/threats/12345/attributes/54321/securityLabels/TLP%3AAMBER

.. note:: In order to add a Security Label to an Attribute, the Security Label must already exist. The query above will not create a new Security Label. If you specify a Security Label that does not exist, it will return an error.

Create Group Security Labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a Security Label to a Group, use the following format, where ``{securityLabel}`` is replaced with the name of a Security Label that already exists in the Owner:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}/securityLabels/{securityLabel}

For example, the query below will add a ``TLP:AMBER`` Security Label to the Threat with ID 12345:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/threats/12345/securityLabels/TLP%3AAMBER

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success"
    }

.. note:: In order to add a Security Label to a Group, the Security Label must already exist. The query above will not create a new Security Label. If you specify a Security Label that does not exist, it will return an error.

Create Group Tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add a Tag to a Group, use the following format where ``{tagName}`` is replaced with the name of the Tag you want to add to the Group:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}/tags/{tagName}

For example, the query below will add the ``Nation State`` Tag to the Threat whose ID is 12345:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/threats/12345/tags/Nation%20State

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success"
    }

.. include:: ../_includes/tag_length.rst

.. include:: ../_includes/apply_attack_tags.rst

Create Adversary Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create an Adversary Asset for an Adversary, use a query in the following format:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/adversaries/{adversaryId}/adversaryAssets/{assetType}

``{assetType}`` can be replaced with the following Asset types:

* handles
* phoneNumbers
* urls

For example, the query below will add ``Pierre Despereaux`` as a Handle to the Adversary with ID 12345:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/adversaries/12345/adversaryAssets/handles

    {
      "handle": "Pierre Despereaux"
    }

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success",
      "data": {
        "adversaryHandle": {
          "id": 1,
          "type": "Handle",
          "webLink": "https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/adversary/adversary.xhtml?adversary=12345",
          "handle": "Pierre Despereaux"
        }
      }
    }

Create Group Associations
-------------------------

Associate Group to Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To associate one Group with another, use a query in the following format:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}/groups/{associatedGroupType}/{associatedGroupId}

Replace ``{associatedGroupType}`` with one of the following Group types:

.. include:: ../_includes/group_types.rst

For example, the query below will associate a Threat with the ID 12345 with an Incident with the ID 54321:

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/threats/12345/groups/incidents/54321

.. code::

    POST /v2/groups/threats/12345/indicators/addresses/0.0.0.0

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success"
    }
