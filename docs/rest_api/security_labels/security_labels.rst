Security Labels
===============

Security Labels included in the ThreatConnect platform provide a means to designate information stored within ThreatConnect as sensitive. When sharing data with partners, or when copying data to and from Communities, Security Labels provide control over what is shared and allow the sharer to redact information based on the Labels. Security Labels can be applied to Indicators, Attributes, Groups, Tasks, and Victims in ThreatConnect.
